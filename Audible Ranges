Problem 
Chef's dog binary hears frequencies starting from 67 Hertz to 45000 Hertz (both inclusive).
If Chef's commands have a frequency of X Hertz, find whether binary can hear them or not.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X - the frequency of Chef's commands in Hertz.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if binary can hear Chef's commands. Otherwise, print NO.
The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Constraints
• 1 ≤T ≤ 10000
• 1 ≤ X ≤ 1000000

Sample 1:
Input               Output     
5                   NO
42                  YES
67                  YES
402                 YES
45000               YES
45005                NO

Explanation:
Test case 1: Chef's command has a frequency of 42 Hertz which is less than 67. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.
Test case 2: Chef's command has a frequency of 67 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.
Test case 3: Chef's command has a frequency of 402 Hertz which lies in the range[67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.
Test case 4: Chef's command has a frequency of 45000 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.
Test case 5: Chef's command has a frequency of 45005 Hertz which is greater than 45000. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.

Solution:
PYTHON3
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if(n >= 67 and n <= 45000):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
