Problem 1
Audible Ranges
Chef's dog binary hears frequencies starting from 67 Hertz to 45000 Hertz (both inclusive).
If Chef's commands have a frequency of X Hertz, find whether binary can hear them or not.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of a single integer X - the frequency of Chef's commands in Hertz.

Output Format
For each test case, output on a new line YES, if binary can hear Chef's commands. Otherwise, print NO.
The output is case-insensitive. Thus, the strings YES, yes, yeS, and Yes are all considered the same.

Constraints
•	1 ≤T ≤ 10000
•	1 ≤ X ≤ 1000000

Sample 1:
Input        Output     
5            NO
42           YES
67           YES
402          YES
45000        YES
45005        NO

Explanation:
Test case 11: Chef's command has a frequency of 42 Hertz which is less than 67. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.

Test case 22: Chef's command has a frequency of 67 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.

Test case 33: Chef's command has a frequency of 402402 Hertz which lies in the range[67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.

Test case 44: Chef's command has a frequency of 4500045000 Hertz which lies in the range [67,45000]. Thus, it would be audible to binary.

Test case 55: Chef's command has a frequency of 4500545005 Hertz which is greater than 45000. Thus, it would not be audible to binary.


Solution:
PYTHON3
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(input())
    if(n >= 67 and n <= 45000):
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
