Problem
Chef initially had two non-empty arrays A and B, where both arrays contain distinct elements. Moreover, there is no common element in the arrays A and B.
Chef forms another array C from the arrays A and B using the following process :
Let XX denote the leftmost element of array AA and YY denote the leftmost element of array BB.
If Y is smaller than X, delete Y from B and append it to the end of C.
If X is smaller than Y, delete X from A and append it to the end of C.
If either array A or B becomes empty, append all the remaining elements of the other array to the end of C.
Chef forgot the arrays A and B but remembers the array C. Find any two valid non-empty arrays A and B that will yield the given array C. If it is not possible, print -−1.

Input Format
The first line of input will contain a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case consists of multiple lines of input.
The first line of each test case contains a space-separated integer N — the number of elements in array C.
The next line contains N space-separated integers denoting the elements of the array C.

Output Format
For each test case, if a solutions exists, print any two valid arrays A and B along with their lengths respectively . For example, if A=[1,7] and B=[4,10,2], then print it as :
2 
1 7
3
4 10 2
Else, if answer doesn't exist, print -−1 in a single line.

Constraints
•	1 ≤ T ≤ 100
•	1 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
•	-10^5 ≤ Ci ≤ 10^5
•	The sum of N over all test cases won't exceed 10^6.

Sample 1:
Input             Output
2                 3
6                 7 6 3
7 6 3 8 2 9       3
2                 8 2 9
2 1               -1

Explanation:
Test case 1: We have A=[7,6,3] B=[8,2,9].
Move 1: X=7 and Y=8. Since X<Y, we delete X and append it to C. Thus, A = [6, 3], B = [8, 2, 9],and C = [7].
Move 2: X=6 and Y=8. Since X<Y, we delete X and append it to C. Thus, A = [3], B = [8, 2, 9], and C = [7,6].
Move 3: X=3 and Y=8. SinceX<Y, we delete X and append it to C. Thus, A = [], B = [8, 2, 9], and C = [7,6,3].
Now, since A is empty, append all elements of B to C. Thus, C = [7, 6, 3, 8, 2, 9].

Test case 2: It can be shown that there exist no valid non-empty arrays A and B.

Solution:
C++17

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

void solve () {
	    int n;
	    cin>>n;
	    int a[n];
	    for(int i =0; i <n; i++)
	        cin>>a[i];
	        int maxy = 0;
	        for(int i = 0; i<n; i++){
	            if(a[i] > a[maxy])
	            maxy = i;
	        }
	        if(maxy==0){
	            cout<<-1<<endl;
	        }else{
	            cout<<maxy<<endl;
	            for(int i = 0; i < maxy; i++)
	                cout<<a[i]<<' ';
	                cout<<endl;
	                cout<<n -maxy<<endl;
	                for(int i = maxy; i<n; i++)
	                cout<<a[i]<<' ';
	                cout<<endl;
	        }
	    }
int main(){
int t; cin>>t; while(t--)
